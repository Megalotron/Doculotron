Used to specify the name of the file to read data from, later on used to generate the flows.

## `-output`

Once the flow have been generated and their corresponding features extracted, the results are dumped into a file.

## `-address`

This helps go-flowmeter to know what is the IP to reach the machine running the gRPC server to read data from.

Same as above, but for the port instead of the IP.

## `-logs`

Specifies the log severity to use when running go-flowmeter.
